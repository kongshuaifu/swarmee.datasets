Simple Scripts to illustrate Getting Data into the Elastic Stack

There are two types of examples ones that only require curl to post the data into elastic search, and those that use logstash.
The logstash examples include a bash script that initiates the process.

Almost all of the data is pulled from wikipedia and formatted as CSV for easy loading in elasticsearch.
